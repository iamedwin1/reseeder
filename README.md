a small script which finds folder/file locations for torrents, and then adds them to the client to seed.

# why?

my music and movie folders are split across multiple storage drives. whenever i reinstall or distro hop, etc. one of the more tedious things to is reseed everything. i decided to write out a couple more features and make this public. someone might find it helpful.

# install

run `npm install`

# usage

`npm start -i [torrent folder/file] -i [another torrent folder/file] -f [search path] -f [another search path]`
invoke `npm start` to read the other options.
